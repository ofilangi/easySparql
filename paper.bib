	abstract = {The life sciences field is entering an era of big data with the breakthroughs of science and technology. More and more big data-related projects and activities are being performed in the world. Life sciences data generated by new technologies are continuing to grow in not only size but also variety and complexity, with great speed. To ensure that big data has a major influence in the life sciences, comprehensive data analysis across multiple data sources and even across disciplines is indispensable. The increasing volume of data and the heterogeneous, complex varieties of data are two principal issues mainly discussed in life science informatics. The ever-evolving next-generation Web, characterized as the Semantic Web, is an extension of the current Web, aiming to provide information for not only humans but also computers to semantically process large-scale data. The paper presents a survey of big data in life sciences, big data related projects and Semantic Web technologies. The paper introduces the main Semantic Web technologies and their current situation, and provides a detailed analysis of how Semantic Web technologies address the heterogeneous variety of life sciences big data. The paper helps to understand the role of Semantic Web technologies in the big data era and how they provide a promising solution for the big data in life sciences.},

To support this task, we introduce {FORUM}: a Knowledge Graph ({KG}) providing a semantic representation of relations between chemicals and biomedical concepts, built from a federation of life science databases and scientific literature repositories.The use of a Semantic Web framework on biological data allows us to apply ontological-based reasoning to infer new relations between entities. We show that these new relations provide different levels of abstraction and could open the path to new hypotheses. We estimate the statistical relevance of each extracted relation, explicit or inferred, using an enrichment analysis, and instantiate them as new knowledge in the {KG} to support results interpretation/further inquiries.A web interface to browse and download the extracted relations, as well as a {SPARQL} endpoint to directly probe the whole {FORUM} {KG}, are available at https://forum-webapp.semantic-metabolomics.fr.

    abstract = "{In human health research, metabolic signatures extracted from metabolomics data have a strong added value for stratifying patients and identifying biomarkers. Nevertheless, one of the main challenges is to interpret and relate these lists of discriminant metabolites to pathological mechanisms. This task requires experts to combine their knowledge with information extracted from databases and the scientific literature. However, we show that most compounds (\\&gt;99\\%) in the PubChem database lack annotated literature. This dearth of available information can have a direct impact on the interpretation of metabolic signatures, which is often restricted to a subset of significant metabolites. To suggest potential pathological phenotypes related to overlooked metabolites that lack annotated literature, we extend the “guilt-by-association” principle to literature information by using a Bayesian framework. The underlying assumption is that the literature associated with the metabolic neighbors of a compound can provide valuable insights, or an a priori, into its biomedical context. The metabolic neighborhood of a compound can be defined from a metabolic network and correspond to metabolites to which it is connected through biochemical reactions. With the proposed approach, we suggest more than 35,000 associations between 1,047 overlooked metabolites and 3,288 diseases (or disease families). All these newly inferred associations are freely available on the FORUM ftp server (see information at https://github.com/eMetaboHUB/Forum-LiteraturePropagation).}",

In this paper, we demonstrate how a series of cases illustrating common types of change may be represented by universals, defined classes, and relations employing the BFO framework. We provide discussion of these cases to provide a template for other ontologists using BFO, as well as to facilitate comparison with the strategies proposed by ontologists using different top-level ontologies.},

While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here, we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology’s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable, federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).Database URL http://obofoundry.org/}",

However, those ontologies are spread out, in different formats, of different size, with different structures and from overlapping domains. Therefore, there is need for a common platform to receive and host them, align them, and enabling their use in agro-informatics applications. By reusing the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) BioPortal technology, we have designed AgroPortal, an ontology repository for the agronomy domain. The AgroPortal project re-uses the biomedical domain’s semantic tools and insights to serve agronomy, but also food, plant, and biodiversity sciences. We offer a portal that features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, comment, and recommendation; enables semantic annotation; stores and exploits ontology alignments; and enables interoperation with the semantic web. The AgroPortal specifically satisfies requirements of the agronomy community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS vocabularies and trait dictionaries) and supported features (offering detailed metadata and advanced annotation capabilities). In this paper, we present our platform’s content and features, including the additions to the original technology, as well as preliminary outputs of five driving agronomic use cases that participated in the design and orientation of the project to anchor it in the community. By building on the experience and existing technology acquired from the biomedical domain, we can present in AgroPortal a robust and feature-rich repository of great value for the agronomic domain.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-7-97},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the vast amounts of biomedical data being generated by high-throughput analysis methods, controlled vocabularies and ontologies are becoming increasingly important to annotate units of information for ease of search and retrieval. Each scientific community tends to create its own locally available ontology. The interfaces to query these ontologies tend to vary from group to group. We saw the need for a centralized location to perform controlled vocabulary queries that would offer both a lightweight web-accessible user interface as well as a consistent, unified SOAP interface for automated queries.
RESULTS: The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) was created to integrate publicly available biomedical ontologies into a single database. All modified ontologies are updated daily. A list of currently loaded ontologies is available online. The database can be queried to obtain information on a single term or to browse a complete ontology using AJAX. Auto-completion provides a user-friendly search mechanism. An AJAX-based ontology viewer is available to browse a complete ontology or subsets of it. A programmatic interface is available to query the webservice using SOAP. The service is described by a WSDL descriptor file available online. A sample Java client to connect to the webservice using SOAP is available for download from SourceForge. All OLS source code is publicly available under the open source Apache Licence.
CONCLUSION: The OLS provides a user-friendly single entry point for publicly available ontologies in the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) format. It can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {PubChem} is an open repository for chemical structures, biological activities and biomedical annotations. Semantic Web technologies are emerging as an increasingly important approach to distribute and integrate scientific data. Exposing {PubChem} data to Semantic Web services may help enable automated data integration and management, as well as facilitate interoperable web applications.
{DESCRIPTION}: This work, one of a series covering the {PubChemRDF} project, describes an approach to translate {PubChem} Substance and Compound information into Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) format. Basic examples are provided to demonstrate its use. The aim of this effort is to provide two new primary benefits to researchers in a cost-effective manner. Firstly, we aim to remove the inherent limitations of using the web-based resource {PubChem} by allowing a researcher to use readily available semantic technologies (namely, {RDF} triple stores and their corresponding {SPARQL} query engines) to query and analyze {PubChem} data on local computing resources. Secondly, this work intends to help improve data sharing, analysis, and integration of {PubChem} data to resources external to {NCBI} and across scientific domains, by means of the association of {PubChem} data to existing ontological frameworks, including {CHEMical} {INFormation} ontology, Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, and others.
{CONCLUSIONS}: With the goal of semantically describing information available in the {PubChem} archive, pre-existing ontological frameworks were used, rather than creating new ones. Semantic relationships between compounds and substances, chemical descriptors associated with compounds and substances, interrelationships between chemicals, as well as provenance and attribute metadata of substances are described.
